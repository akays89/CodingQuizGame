# CodingQuizGame
<h1> Description </h1>
<p>I created this application for a quiz game that asks questions about coding.This application was developed using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. I was able to make this work using for loops if- else statements. I also usedseInterval, clearInterval and addEventListener functions.I used local storage to store remaining time and high scores so that they were logged on the high scores page witht the submitted initials.</p>
